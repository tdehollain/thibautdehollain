									<p class="middleContent" id="mechEng">I have been a car enthusiast for as far as I can remember, and naturally working in car engineering had always been my objective. I had some doubt at the age of 13 and 14, when math grades put me at the very bottom of the class, but after years of hard studying (I probably will never forgot this winter of 2005 when we somehow had to know inside-out a stack of 29cm of equations-loaded coursework), I eventually came out in 2007 with my Mechanical Engineering degree from the Catholic University Of Louvain.</p>
									<p>I carried out my Master Thesis together with my old buddy Guillaume de Volder at the Von Karman Institute, one of the leading aerodynamics research institutes worldwide (they have some really cool machinery, like a facility that allows testing models up to Mach 20!). Our objective was to create a numerical model for their largest wind tunnel. This allows scientists to replace their physical tests with virtual ones, at a fraction of the cost. Our task quickly turned into developing a methodology to drastically speed up simulations with Fluent &#174.</p>
								</div>

								<div id="cuEng" class="descr hidden">
									<img class= "lmsLogo" src="img/logoLMS.png">
									<p class="middleContent" id="cuEng">The car industry being quite limited in Belgium, I decided to enter <a href="www.limsintl.com">LMS International</a>, a young and fast-rowing company, global leader in mechanical simulation. That choice was motivated by the fact that most of its business is in the car industry.</p>
									<p>I started as a Customer Services Engineer, which is the entry door to the company. That consists in helping customers solve their technical issues, giving trainings to new customers (which can be a bit challenging when you've known the software for half a year!), and pre-sales activities such as demonstrating the software to potential customers.</p>
									<p>I fared quite well in that position, as during 2008 I solved over 400 customer issues and over 700 internal issues (questions from regional offices), both company records.</p>
									<p>But once the learning curve flattened out, I needed a new challenge. I asked to take on a more international role and was promoted to Technical Account Consultant to advise Daimler (Mercedes-Benz), working full-time on-site at their main development center in Stuttgart, Germany.</p>
								</div>

								<div id="TAC" class="descr hidden">
									<img class="mbLogo" src="img/logoMB2.png"><!--  -->
									<p class="middleContent" id="TAC">I enjoyed a pretty rough start in my new role, as the client was dissatisfied with our software and was planning to roll back to our competitor. The first thing my predecessor told was "my bet is that they will ask you to finish the development cycle for the S-class, thank you for your services and move back to the competitor". A real challenge then.</p>
									<p>The first thing I did was understanding the client's simulation process, which is very, VERY complex. That allowed me to see how they were not taking advantage of the full potential of our solution (hell, the current workflow was barely using 10% of the potential).</p>
									<p>I then set about at finding the influencer(s) in the client's team. It turned out not to be the team leader, but an engineer freshly coming out of Daimler's high potential rotational program. I quickly developed a strong relationship with him and together we started sketching out an interface that would automate a number of tasks that were being done manually. After 6-8 months of daily discussions about design, functionality and implementation, I had created a fully automated interface that improved the overall process by about 80%.</p>
									<p>I remember something he said to me: "we're engineers, we are here to design suspensions, not figure out how to have the software do what it's supposed to do."</p>
								</div>

								<div id="MBA" class="descr hidden">
									<img class= "ieLogo" src="img/logoIE.png" width="75">
									<p class="middleContent" id="MBA">My experience as an engineer was great, I learned a lot in these four years.</p>
									<p>But I also learned a lot about myself. First I confirmed that what drives me is go to clients, understand their problem, and fix it. I also learned that I want to work in a role that is much more all encompassing. I understood that I have an almost stifling need of diversity on the job, and I want to have a job to brings me that. I love dealing with various tasks, people of different functions, of different cultures. Routine definitely bores me to death. </p>
									<p>This all led me to go back to school to pursue an MBA at IE Business School in Madrid.</p>
									<p>Among many activities, the most important of them was definitely the IE Consulting Project, in which we carry a real consulting project for a major FMCG company based in the UK. This project is nothing like your typical MBA project because it is real. We have a real client to deliver to, and the school's reputation is on the line. Our task was to investigate the factors that drive factories to consume more water and energy than others. It was a lot of data mining, which means transforming raw data into insights. I learned a lot in this project, most importantly the fact that making the insights look sexy is just as important (if not more) as the insight itself.</p>

							<h3>Web Design & Development</h3>
							<div id="webDesignDiv" class="interestDiv">
								<p>I haven't been reading about Web Technology for too long, about 2 years I'd say. But it has fully grown into a real passion. The more you read about it, the more you get excited at picturing the future of computing. My interest for the field started at about the same time as HTML5 started becoming widespread. And once you know how easy it can be to design a decent website, you quickly realize that 80% of all websites (especially in Europe) are just dreadful: outdated technology, old usability patterns and pass√© design.</p>
								<p>Why did I get so much interest for Web Design? I think that has to do with the ease with which you can build something by yourself.</p>
								<p>So I spend much of my free time learning and keeping up with the latest technologies. That's no easy task given the amount of new developments each week!</p>
								<p>I am particularly excited about Node.js, mostly because it allows server-side Javascript. It's not necessarily its biggest selling point (that would be its scalability), but that's what draws me to it. After learning HTML, CSS and Javascript, you're not too motivated to learn PHP and especially the antique-loking MySQL. So as far as I'm concerned, Node.js and MongoDB running on Amazon EC2 is a good starting hand.</p>

							<h3>Cars</h3>
							<div  id="carsDiv" class="interestDiv">
								<p>I've been a car enthusiast for as far as I can remember. My ultimate goal of my teenage years was to study mechanical engineering so I could become an engineer at a car company. I reached that objective, and worked 3 years at the heart of Mercedes-Benz's main development center in Stuttgart.</p>
								<p>Even though I have left that path, I still read a lot about cars. I have in my short term plans to build an app that keeps track of the used car prices.</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li id="cinema">
							<h3>Cinema</h3>
							<div id="cinemaDiv" class="interestDiv">
								<p>Cinema is certainly the form of art that touches me the most. My state of mind during a good movie is unlike any other - I really live the movie. I almost never pause a movie or start a movie thinking "I'll pause it half-way and watch the rest tomorrow". Unlike many I'm not very interested in a good scenario or the actor's performance. There are three elements that make a good movie: intensity, visual beauty and soundtrack. To me Sunshine (2007, Danny Boyle) reaches perfection in all 3 aspects. After I saw it the first time, I realized I had been squashing my hands for the last 30 minutes of the movie. I have seen that movie around 10 times now and still immensely enjoy the experience.</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li id="photo">
							<h3>Photography</h3>
							<div id="photoDiv" class="interestDiv">
								<p>If you have read why I love cinema you won't be surprized that I'm also passionate about photography. I have long tried to understand what makes the difference between a good photo and a great photo. You can tell which one "looks pro", but you can't tell why. I've picked up a few hints, but I wouldn't say I have the photographer's eye. You can see some of my best photos on Photographer.io (just search for my name).</p>
							</div>
						</li>
						<li id="cooking">
							<h3>Cooking</h3>
							<div id="cookingDiv" class="interestDiv">
								<p>I grew up in France, so it's no surprise I like good food! There is something about French and Belgian restaurants, a certain love of the meal well prepared that you find almost nowhere else. Fun fact: Belgium has more Michelin stars per capita than France :). And so I always try to cook myself some decent dinners and to learn new recipes. This is what led me to create the Stuttgart Expat Dinners (see the Recent Work section), where my close friends and I gathered once a week and in which each successively cooked a great dinner. Great times!</p>

						</li>
						<li id="elephants">
							<h3>Elephants</h3>
							<div id="elephantsDiv" class="interestDiv">
								<p>Yes elephants! The elephant is the most majestic animal, but is also one of most intelligent: it is one of the very few animals that can pass the mirror test (and no, dogs can't!). They use tools! Tools! Only apes use tools! Elephants also very advanced in terms of  social organization: they evolve in families, display amazing solidarity within the group and have funeral rites. I find all that really amazing. </p>
